# ajl-poster 

This is a modified version of the [Quarto poster](https://github.com/quarto-ext/typst-templates/tree/main/poster) format. The current version results in an error regarding the headings when the user attempts to render the poster. As a result, this template is virtually the same as the Quarto version but with heading numbers removed. 

To reflect my current (as of 10/5/2025) status as a student at the University of California, San Diego, I replaced the NCSU logo with one from UCSD. The default font has also been changed to Fira Sans.

## Installing

To install, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
quarto use template andrewjliang/ajl-poster
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

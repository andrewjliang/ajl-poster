# ajl-poster 

This is a modified version of the [Quarto poster](https://github.com/quarto-ext/typst-templates/tree/main/poster) format. The current version results in an error regarding the headings when the user attempts to render the poster. As a result, this template is virtually the same as the Quarto version but with heading numbers removed. 

## Installing

_TODO_: Replace the `<github-organization>` with your GitHub organization.

```bash
quarto use template <github-organization>/ajl-poster
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

## Using

_TODO_: Describe how to use your format.
